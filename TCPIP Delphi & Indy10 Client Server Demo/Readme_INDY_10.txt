INDY 10 CLIENT SERVER DEMO
-----------------------------

* use SVN to download the latest code version  
* working with INDY 10 - DELPHI 2010, XE , DELPHI XE 2   
* a demo project on source forge 


Note #6 July 2012
-------------------
It is not GENERIC or INDY !!!   I did not read the INDY instruction in detail and recognize
the VCL is NOT TREAD SAFE!!!   This is well known.
Please remove all VCL command in my server.execute sample  -> this is the correct way !!!! 
If I find a time slot I will change also the sample 



Note #5 June 2012
-------------------
Please use only the NO GENRIC SAMPLES in your own application- Guess still something is wrong with GENERICS
and INDY. We will solve that issue now! 





Note #4 April 2012
-------------------

meanwhile lot of new samples are added, only sample #3 (complex demo keeps me in trouble)
pls. post some notes in the forum about future code improvements ...
did someone get sample 3 running ... pls. leave a note
